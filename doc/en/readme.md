* **Developer:** Erol Ulker <m.erolulker@gmail.com>
* **Version:** 1.4.0
* **License:** GNU GPL v2

Radyocu is a lightweight, fast, and accessible add-on that allows NVDA screen reader users to listen to online radio stations directly through NVDA, without opening a web browser.

This add-on fully supports **English, Turkish, German, French, Spanish, and Italian**. The interface language automatically adjusts to your NVDA language settings.

## Features

### 1. Advanced Search (Two Methods)
* **Search by Name:** Instantly search through thousands of stations using the "Radio-Browser" global database.
* **Play by Link (URL):** If you have a direct stream link (http/https), simply paste it into the search box to play. The add-on attempts to automatically fetch the station name.

### 2. Smart Favorites
* Every station you play is automatically added to your "Favorites" list.
* The list is always sorted alphabetically (A-Z).
* You can delete specific stations via the "Options" menu.

### 3. List Management (M3U)
* **Import:** Bulk import existing `.m3u` playlists from other players like VLC.
* **Export:** Backup your favorites list as an `.m3u` file to share or save.

### 4. Background Playback
* You can hide the window using `ESC` while the radio is playing. It continues to play in the background with minimal system resource usage.
